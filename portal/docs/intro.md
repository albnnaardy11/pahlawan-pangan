# Introduction: The Future of Food Rescue

Welcome to the **Pahlawan Pangan Technical Portal**. This platform represents a quantum leap in humanitarian technology, designed to solve food waste at a national scale (Indonesia-Wide) using distributed systems architecture.

## Platform Pillars

The ecosystem is built on four revolutionary technology pillars that elevate "food rescue" into a Tier-1 tech operation.

### 1. High-Performance Matching
Our core engine handles **10M+ daily transactions** with sub-800ms P95 latency. By utilizing geo-sharded actor models, we ensure that every gram of surplus food finds a home before it expires.

### 2. Predictive Intelligence (Pahlawan-AI)
We don't just react to waste; we predict it. Our AI models analyze weather patterns, cultural events, and historical sales to alert providers hours before surplus occurs.

### 3. Native Logistics (Pahlawan-Express)
Integrated courier matching and **Community Group Buys** minimize the "Last Mile" cost barrier, making food rescue accessible to citizens in every corner of the archipelago.

### 4. ESG & Carbon Credit (Pahlawan-Carbon)
We monetize sustainability. By digitizing CO2 prevention, we allow businesses (Hotels/Catering) to earn Carbon Tokens, transforming food waste into a strategic b2b asset.
